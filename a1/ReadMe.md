



This project contains two Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files that demonstrate basic operations using core Python libraries used in data science and machine learning.

These notebooks can be opened and run directly in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab environments.

Included Notebooks:

1. Python_Libraries.ipynb

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to:

* Learn and perform basic operations using NumPy for numerical array processing
* Use Pandas for handling and analyzing structured data
* Utilize SciPy for scientific computing such as statistical analysis and optimization
* Apply Scikit-Learn for basic machine learning tasks such as classification and regression

## File Descriptions

PythonLibraries.ipynb
\- Demonstrates core NumPy concepts like arrays, indexing, slicing, broadcasting
\- Covers basic Pandas tasks such as loading data, filtering, grouping, and merging
\- Shows how to use SciPy for statistics and optimization
\- Introduces Scikit-Learn for model fitting, prediction, and evaluation
iris.ipynb
\-Performed simple machine learning model for iris dataset

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository containing the .ipynb files
2. Open the files in a Jupyter environment (Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab)
3. Run the cells sequentially to see the outputs and understand each step


To run these notebooks locally, you need Python installed with the following libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* scipy
* scikit-learn

You can install all dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn
```
