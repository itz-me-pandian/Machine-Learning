Machine Learning Assignment 2

This repository contains the implementation of various data preprocessing and machine learning tasks as part of Assignment 2 for the Machine Learning Lab.

üìÅ Contents

The notebook includes the following steps:

    1. Importing Libraries
        Essential Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn are imported.

    2. Reading and Exploring the Dataset
        Reads the dataset from Google Drive, explores structure, checks for missing values, and performs EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

    3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
        ‚ó¶ Missing value imputation using SimpleImputer.
        ‚ó¶ Label encoding of categorical features.
        ‚ó¶ Data normalization/standardization.
        
    4. Model Implementation
        ‚ó¶ Linear Regression
        
    5. Model Evaluation
        ‚ó¶ Accuracy Score
        ‚ó¶ MSE
        ‚ó¶ MAE
        ‚ó¶ RMSE
        ‚ó¶ R2
        ‚ó¶ Adjusted R2
        
    6. Cross Fold validation
        Demonstrates how k fold validation impacts model performance.

üìä Dataset

The Link of the dataset used in this assignment is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phileinsophos/predict-loan-amount-data

The dataset used in this assignment is assumed to be related to loan amount prediction problems and is accessed via Google Drive. If you'd like to run the notebook locally, ensure that the dataset path is correctly specified and the required file is uploaded.

üîß Requirements

To run this notebook, install the following Python libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

    1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
    2. Mount your Google Drive if running in Colab.
    3. Ensure the dataset is available at the specified path.
    4. Run each cell in order to replicate results.
